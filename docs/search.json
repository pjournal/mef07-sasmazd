    "text": "1.2 Posit Videos\nI choose ‚ÄúData Visualization and Plotting with Shiny for Python‚Äù and ‚ÄúShiny Programming Practices‚Äù videos. The main reason is my interest in data visualization, especially at work. After learning some about Shiny, I decided to watch the second video too.\n\n1.2.1 Data Visualization and Plotting with Shiny for Python\n\n\n\n\nIn the first video, there is a discussion about the development of an interactive web application using Shiny, a web application framework for R, and its integration with various data visualization tools. It covers creating interactive applications with Shiny, explaining reactive calculations, using the render plot function for data visualization, introducing its wide compatibility with different packages, and providing practical code examples for using visualization libraries within the Shiny application.\n\n\n1.2.2 Shiny Programming Practices\n\n\n\n\nThe second video reflects on the author‚Äôs experiences building UIs using traditional event-driven methods. It mentions the concept of a ‚Äúreactive graph‚Äù in frameworks like Shiny for R. He draws an analogy between functions and reactive components, explains the need for modules to be easily understandable."

They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform.\nThe dataset provides details about a wide range of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including information about their release year, rating, duration, and more. It‚Äôs a comprehensive dataset for exploring the Netflix content library.\nThis dataset offers an engaging and relevant way to teach data analysis, data visualization, and recommendation systems, all within the context of a popular streaming platform. I believe it allows students to work with real-world data while learning valuable data science skills.\nDataset Kaggle Link"
